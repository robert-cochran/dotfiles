TODO    BROKEN .fzf.zshrc 
        .fzf.zshrc isnt being loaded by zsh when linked into the symlinked 
        .zsh_alias dir

TODO    command t and the other one
        get the other shortcut commands working
        namely the one that finds strings inside the current dir
        and the other one that searches for filenames
