TODO    symlink
        linking .fzf.zshrc and .vim.zshrc from their app folders in the 
        repo might save the link path in the repo. dont really want to 
        be saving my home dir path in the repo so will either need to 
        have those files be gitignored or move them from their app 
        folders back into the zsh_alias folder and not symlinked there
