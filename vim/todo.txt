TODO    vim.tasks and other plugins
        port my vim plugins to their own repo so i can pull them with the vim
        plugin manager instead of keeping them in this repo

TODO    New shortcut that deletes selection AND places into my clipboard 
        so i dont have to yank then reselect the same content to delete

TODO    command to send current selection to a new file with filename as arg

TODO    vimscripts in plugin/tasks arent being loaded. like Move.
        also syntax isn't being loaded. 

TODO    alignment
        - https://github.com/junegunn/vim-easy-align
        - https://github.com/kg8m/vim-simple-align

TODO    .swp files
        Need to handle these better when file surfing through vim 
        because i keep colliding into already open files thats either in another
        pane/window/session
