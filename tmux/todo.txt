TODO Maybe a gimmick but cool feature to display notification 
NOTE: (requires bash and tmux updates)

TODO Tmux + Vim pane navigation
    Swap between vim and tmux panes with the same keys
- https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator

TODO split .tmux.conf into smaller files 
- to finding settings easier
- also might be worth replacing existing content with plugins
    e.g. my existing yank code with https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-yank
